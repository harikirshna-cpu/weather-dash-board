Install Required Libraries
If you already have a requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Otherwise, install manually:
pip install requests matplotlib
(tkinter is already included with Python on Windows, macOS, and most Linux distributions.)
2. Get an API Key
Go to OpenWeather
Sign up for a free account.
Copy your API key (itâ€™s a long string).
3. Add API Key to Code
Inside your Python script (main.py), you should have a place to store or prompt for the API key.
For example:
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual OpenWeather API key.
4. Run the Script
Navigate to your project folder in terminal or command prompt and run:
python main.py
(or python3 main.py on Linux/Mac)
This should open your Weather Dashboard GUI window.
